# Booking-Adda-Data-Analysis
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of booking and ride data using SQL and Power BI. This project includes insightful dashboards and key metrics to uncover trends, patterns, and optimization opportunities in the ride-booking industry.

## Project Overview

In this project, Iâ€™ve worked with a dataset containing booking information, focusing on various KPIs such as ride volume, booking status, customer ratings, vehicle types, payment methods, and more. The goal was to identify key patterns, trends, and opportunities for optimization within the ride booking process.

### Key Highlights:
- **SQL Analysis**: Conducted SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer critical business questions and uncover trends.
    - Analyzed booking status, booking values, and cancellations.
    - Identified the top-performing vehicle types and their associated booking values.
    - Evaluated trends related to payment methods and customer ratings.

- **Power BI Visualizations**: Built interactive dashboards to visualize trends and patterns, including:
    - **Ride Volume Over Time**
    - **Booking Status Breakdown**
    - **Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance**
    - **Revenue by Payment Method**
    - **Customer vs. Driver Ratings**

### Key Achievements:
- Delivered actionable insights into booking patterns and customer behavior.
- Developed clear visualizations to present complex data for better decision-making.
- Built reports that demonstrate the impact of various factors like vehicle types and payment methods on overall ride bookings.

### Tools Used:
- **SQL**: Data extraction and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Data transformation & modeling via power query, Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and validation.
